# Tell me about yourself

Hi, I'm Sivaramakrishna, a DevOps Engineer with 4 years of hands-on experience at Vaayuja Info Solutions. I specialize in automating build and deployment processes for applications running on Amazon EKS, and I’ve been actively involved in setting up CI/CD pipelines for various types of applications.

As part of my role, I integrate security tools into the pipeline to catch vulnerabilities early in the development cycle. I manage infrastructure using Terraform, and have strong hands-on experience with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Helm.

I’ve also implemented robust monitoring and logging solutions using Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch, and the Elastic Stack to ensure application and infrastructure reliability. I actively provide on-call support and collaborate closely with cross-functional teams to streamline operations.

One of the key projects I contributed to was the migration of applications from virtual machines to a serverless architecture. I developed reusable Terraform modules for provisioning infrastructure involving ECS, S3, CloudFront, and other AWS services.

Overall, I’m passionate about building efficient DevOps workflows that enable faster, more reliable, and secure deployments.
