## **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**  
To host our applications, we need infrastructure like **network, compute, storage, databases, load balancers, and auto scaling groups (ASG)**.  
### **Why manually creating infrastructure is not ideal?**  
Manually setting up all these components has several disadvantages:  
- **Time-consuming** â€“ Setting up infrastructure manually takes a lot of effort.  
- **Prone to errors** â€“ Human mistakes can lead to misconfigurations.  
- **No consistency across environments** â€“ Recreating the same infrastructure for different environments (dev, staging, prod) is difficult.
- Creating resources manually one by one is time-consuming and requires handling dependencies manually.
- **No tracking facility** â€“ Hard to audit **who made what changes**.  
- **Lack of inventory management** â€“ No easy way to keep track of created resources.  
- **No version control for infrastructure** â€“ Cannot roll back changes or collaborate efficiently.  
### **Solution? Manage Infrastructure as Code (IaC)!**  
To solve all these issues, the industry came up with an idea â€“ **why not manage our infrastructure as code?**  
### **Benefits of IaC:**  
âœ… **Version Control System (VCS)** â€“ Our infrastructure is stored as code, making it easy to track and manage changes.  
âœ… **Consistency across environments** â€“ We can easily **replicate** infrastructure across **dev, staging, and prod**.  
âœ… **Change tracking** â€“ Helps in identifying **who made what changes**.  
âœ… **Avoids configuration drift** â€“ Ensures infrastructure remains consistent.  
âœ… **CRUD operations on the fly** â€“ Infrastructure changes (Create, Update, Delete) can be done **quickly and efficiently**.  
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Easily scale infrastructure as needed.

## **Terraform â€“ One of the Popular IaC Tools**  
ðŸ”¹ **Uses HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)** to define infrastructure.  
ðŸ”¹ **Maintains a state file** to track resources managed by Terraform.  
ðŸ”¹ **Supports remote storage** for securing the state file.  
ðŸ”¹ **Implements state locking** to **avoid parallel execution issues**.  
ðŸ”¹ **Follows the DRY principle** using **modules** to **reuse infrastructure code** efficiently. 
Terraform automatically resolves internal dependencies between resources.
For external dependencies, we can use depends_on to manage resource creation order.
Terraform also creates resources in parallel, improving efficiency and reducing deployment time.
