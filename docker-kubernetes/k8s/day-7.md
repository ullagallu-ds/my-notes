# Schduling
- default scheduler takes care about pod placemnet in the nodes it does not consider any constriants based on default algorithm it will find best fit node for pod 
- To control Pod placement based on specific constraints, we can use:
`Node Selector:` Assigns Pods to specific nodes based on labels.
`Node Affinity & Anti-Affinity:` Provides more advanced control over node selection using rules (soft and hard constraints).
`Taints & Tolerations:` Ensures that only specific Pods can be scheduled on tainted nodes, preventing unwanted scheduling.

**assigning labels**
kubectl label node <node-name> key=value
**get labels of nodes**
kubectl get nodes --show-labels
kubectl get node <node-name> --show-labels
**remove the label**
kubectl label nodes worker-node-1 key-

**node selector example**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      nodeSelector:
        name: siva
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```
**Observations:**
- If the label does not match, the Pod goes into a Pending state.
- During Pod placement, only the nodeSelector label is checked; it is not enforced during execution.

### Affinity & Anti-Affinitiy

Affinity is similar to nodeSelector but more expressive. It allows using set-based operators to check node labels.
Anti-Affinity is the opposite of Affinity, ensuring that Pods do not get scheduled on the same node or within the same topology (e.g., zone, region).

Affinity has two modes:

- requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[mandatory must meet the condition if not pod went to pending state]
The scheduler must meet the rule before placing the Pod.
Functions like nodeSelector, but with a more flexible syntax.
If no matching node is found, the Pod remains in a Pending state.

- preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution[optional if condtion not pod also still place]
The scheduler tries to meet the rule but will still schedule the Pod if no matching node is found.
Acts as a soft constraint rather than a strict requirement.
üìù Note:
In both types, IgnoredDuringExecution means that if the node labels change after scheduling, the Pod continues to run on the assigned node.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
           requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
             nodeSelectorTerms:
             - matchExpressions:
                - key: name
                  operator: In
                  values: ram
```

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
           preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
           - weight: 1
             preference:
                matchExpressions:
                 - key: name
                   operator: In
                   values:
                   - krishna
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

**Pod Affinity**
This ensures frontend pods run on the same node as backend pods.

```yaml
affinity:
  podAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: app
              operator: In
              values:
                - backend
        topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```
üìå Effect:

The frontend pod will only be scheduled on nodes where a backend pod is already running.

üìå Use Cases:

Low-latency communication (e.g., databases and applications).
Services that benefit from being on the same node (e.g., caching services).

**Anti-Affinity**
Ensures web pods do not run on the same node.

```yaml
affinity:
  podAntiAffinity:
    requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
      - labelSelector:
          matchExpressions:
            - key: app
              operator: In
              values:
                - web
        topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"
```

üìå Effect:

Each web pod will be scheduled on a different node to improve availability.
üìå Use Cases:

High availability (avoid all replicas on one node).
Prevent resource contention (spread workloads evenly).

When to Use What?
Pod Affinity ‚Üí When you want pods to run together (e.g., app & database).
