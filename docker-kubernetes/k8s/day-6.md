# **StatefulSet vs Deployment in Kubernetes**  

## **1️⃣ What is a StatefulSet?**
A **StatefulSet** is a Kubernetes controller used to manage stateful applications that **require stable, unique network identities and persistent storage** across Pod restarts.

### **Key Features of StatefulSet**
- **Stable, Unique Pod Names:** Pods are created in a specific order (`pod-0`, `pod-1`, `pod-2`).
- **Ordered Deployment & Scaling:** Ensures Pods start and terminate in sequence.
- **Persistent Storage:** Uses **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)** to maintain data even if the Pod is deleted.
- **Stable Network Identity:** Each Pod gets a **stable hostname** (`pod-0.service-name`).
- **Pod Replacement:** If a Pod crashes, it is replaced with the **same name and storage**.

---

## **2️⃣ Difference Between StatefulSet and Deployment**

| **Feature**            | **StatefulSet** | **Deployment** |
|------------------------|---------------|--------------|
| **Pod Identity**       | Unique & stable (`pod-0`, `pod-1`, etc.) | Randomly assigned names (`pod-random-id`) |
| **Scaling**           | Ordered (one-by-one) | Parallel (all at once) |
| **Storage**           | Uses **Persistent Volumes** for each Pod | Shared or ephemeral storage |
| **Pod Replacement**    | New Pod keeps **same name & storage** | New Pod gets a **different name** |
| **Use Case**          | Databases, Kafka, Zookeeper | Stateless apps like web servers, APIs |
| **Networking**        | Each Pod gets a **stable DNS hostname** | No stable DNS hostname |

---

## **3️⃣ Example: StatefulSet YAML**
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: my-stateful-app
spec:
  serviceName: "my-service"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: nginx
        volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /data
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: data
    spec:
      accessModes: ["ReadWriteOnce"]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```
📌 **Key Points:**  
- Uses **Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs)** to store data.  
- Pods have **stable names** (`my-stateful-app-0`, `my-stateful-app-1`).  
- Requires a **headless service** (`serviceName: "my-service"`) for stable DNS.

## **4️⃣ When to Use StatefulSet vs Deployment?**

| **Scenario** | **Use StatefulSet?** | **Use Deployment?** |
|-------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Stateless App** (e.g., Web Server, API) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Databases** (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Message Queues** (Kafka, RabbitMQ) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Cache Systems** (Redis, Memcached) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Pods Need Persistent Storage** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Rolling Updates Without Order** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

---

### **🚀 Summary**
- **Use StatefulSet** when Pods need **stable identities, persistent storage, and ordered startup/shutdown**.
- **Use Deployment** for **stateless applications that don’t require unique identities**.

# **Headless Service in Kubernetes**  

### **📌 What is a Headless Service?**  
A **Headless Service** in Kubernetes is a **service without a cluster IP** (`ClusterIP: None`). It is used to provide **direct DNS-based discovery** for Stateful applications, allowing clients to connect to individual Pods instead of load-balancing traffic.  

---

### **🎯 Why Use a Headless Service?**
- **Direct Pod Access:** Clients can connect directly to individual Pods using DNS (`pod-0.my-service.default.svc.cluster.local`).
- **No Load Balancing:** Kubernetes does not assign a virtual IP; instead, it returns **Pod IPs directly**.
- **Essential for Stateful Applications:** Used with **StatefulSets** for databases, message queues (Kafka, Zookeeper, Cassandra).
- **Works with DNS-based Service Discovery:** Useful for distributed systems that require **direct communication between instances**.

---

### **🔹 How Does a Headless Service Work?**
- If a Service **has a selector**, Kubernetes creates **DNS records for each Pod**.
- If a Service **doesn’t have a selector**, it simply acts as a DNS record pointing to manually defined endpoints.

---

## **🚀 Example 1: Headless Service for a StatefulSet**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-headless-service
spec:
  clusterIP: None  # Headless Service
  selector:
    app: my-stateful-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```
### **🔹 How to Access Pods?**
Kubernetes will register each Pod’s hostname in the format:  
```
pod-0.my-headless-service.default.svc.cluster.local
pod-1.my-headless-service.default.svc.cluster.local
pod-2.my-headless-service.default.svc.cluster.local
```
✅ **Clients can resolve and connect to individual Pods directly!**  

---

## **🚀 Example 2: Headless Service Without a Selector**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: external-database-service
spec:
  clusterIP: None  # No Load Balancer, just DNS
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 5432
  externalName: my-external-db.example.com
```
📌 **Use Case:** DNS record that simply resolves to `my-external-db.example.com`.

---

## **📌 When to Use a Headless Service?**
| **Use Case** | **Headless Service?** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Stateful applications** (Databases, Kafka, Zookeeper) | ✅ Yes |
| **Pods need direct communication** (e.g., distributed apps) | ✅ Yes |
| **Service needs load balancing** | ❌ No (Use normal Service) |
| **Accessing external services via DNS** | ✅ Yes |

---

## **🔥 Key Takeaways**
✔ A Headless Service (`clusterIP: None`) provides **DNS-based direct access to Pods**.  
✔ Useful for **StatefulSets, distributed systems, and service discovery**.  
✔ It does **not load-balance** traffic but allows applications to discover and communicate with **individual Pods directly**.

# **emptyDir in Kubernetes**  

## **📌 What is emptyDir?**  
`emptyDir` is a type of Kubernetes **ephemeral (temporary) volume** that is created when a Pod starts and deleted when the Pod is removed. It allows containers within the same Pod to **share temporary data**.  

---

## **🎯 Key Features of emptyDir**
- **Lifecycle:** The volume is created when a Pod starts and deleted when the Pod is removed.
- **Ephemeral Storage:** Data is **lost** if the Pod is deleted, but it persists if the container inside the Pod restarts.
- **Shared Storage:** Multiple containers in the same Pod can access the same `emptyDir` volume.
- **Use Cases:** Temporary files, caching, inter-process communication (IPC), scratch space.

---

## **🚀 Example: Using emptyDir in a Pod**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app-container
      image: busybox
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
          name: temp-storage
  volumes:
    - name: temp-storage
      emptyDir: {}  # Creates an emptyDir volume
```
### **🔹 How It Works?**
1. An `emptyDir` volume named **temp-storage** is created when the Pod starts.
2. The **app-container** mounts this volume at `/data`.
3. Any data written inside `/data` is available **only while the Pod is running**.
4. When the Pod is deleted, the data in `emptyDir` is **lost**.

---

## **📌 Example: Sharing Data Between Containers in a Pod**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: shared-data-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: writer
      image: busybox
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo 'Hello from writer' > /data/message; sleep 3600"]
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
          name: shared-storage

    - name: reader
      image: busybox
      command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "cat /data/message; sleep 3600"]
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: /data
          name: shared-storage

  volumes:
    - name: shared-storage
      emptyDir: {}
```
### **🔹 How It Works?**
1. The **writer** container writes `"Hello from writer"` to `/data/message`.
2. The **reader** container reads from `/data/message`.
3. Both containers share the **same volume (`emptyDir`)**, enabling data sharing.

---

## **🔹 Storage Type: Memory vs Disk**
By default, `emptyDir` uses **node disk storage**. You can use memory (`tmpfs`) instead:
```yaml
volumes:
  - name: temp-storage
    emptyDir:
      medium: "Memory"  # Uses RAM instead of disk
```
📌 **Advantage:** Faster read/write but limited by available RAM.  

---

## **📌 When to Use emptyDir?**
| **Use Case** | **emptyDir?** |
|-------------|--------------|
| Temporary storage | ✅ Yes |
| Caching files between containers | ✅ Yes |
| Sharing logs between containers | ✅ Yes |
| Storing important persistent data | ❌ No (Use PersistentVolume) |
| Data needs to survive Pod restarts | ❌ No (Use PersistentVolumeClaim) |

---

## **🔥 Key Takeaways**
✔ `emptyDir` is an **ephemeral, temporary** storage volume.  
✔ It helps containers within the same Pod **share data**.  
✔ **Data is lost** when the Pod is deleted but persists during container restarts.  
✔ Use **`medium: Memory`** for RAM-based fast storage.

# **📌 Dynamic & Static Volume Provisioning in Kubernetes**  

Kubernetes provides **persistent storage** using **PersistentVolumes (PVs)** and **PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)**. Storage can be provisioned in two ways:  

1️⃣ **Static Provisioning** – Manually creating PersistentVolumes.  
2️⃣ **Dynamic Provisioning** – Automatically provisioning storage based on PVC requests.  

---

## **🔹 Static Volume Provisioning**
In static provisioning, the administrator **manually** creates `PersistentVolumes (PVs)`, and users request storage by creating `PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)`.  

### **📝 Example: Static PV and PVC**
#### **1️⃣ Create a PersistentVolume (PV)**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: static-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 5Gi
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  persistentVolumeReclaimPolicy: Retain
  storageClassName: manual
  hostPath:
    path: "/mnt/data"
```
#### **2️⃣ Create a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: static-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: manual
```
#### **🔹 How It Works?**
- The **PV (PersistentVolume)** is manually created and points to a host path.
- The **PVC (PersistentVolumeClaim)** requests storage.
- Kubernetes **binds** the PVC to the available PV.

---

## **🔹 Dynamic Volume Provisioning**
With dynamic provisioning, Kubernetes automatically **creates storage** based on `StorageClass` when a PVC is requested.  

### **📝 Example: Dynamic PV Provisioning using AWS EBS**
#### **1️⃣ Create a StorageClass**
```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ebs-sc
provisioner: ebs.csi.aws.com
parameters:
  type: gp3
reclaimPolicy: Delete
```
#### **2️⃣ Create a PVC**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: dynamic-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 10Gi
  storageClassName: ebs-sc
```
#### **🔹 How It Works?**
- The **PVC requests storage**, specifying `storageClassName: ebs-sc`.
- Kubernetes dynamically provisions an **EBS volume** and binds it to the PVC.
- The underlying storage is managed automatically.

## **📌 EBS CSI Driver Installation**
To use AWS EBS with Kubernetes, install the **EBS CSI Driver**.

### **🛠 Install AWS EBS CSI Driver Using Helm**
```bash
helm repo add aws-ebs-csi-driver https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-ebs-csi-driver/
helm install aws-ebs-csi-driver aws-ebs-csi-driver/aws-ebs-csi-driver -n kube-system
```
---

## **📌 Volume Reclaim Policies**
Defines what happens when a PV is released.

| **Reclaim Policy** | **Behavior** |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Retain** | PV is not deleted; manual cleanup is required. |
| **Delete** | PV is deleted when the PVC is deleted (for dynamically provisioned volumes). |
| **Recycle** | Deprecated – attempts to wipe the PV before reuse. |

---

## **📌 Access Modes**
Defines how volumes can be accessed by Pods.

| **Access Mode** | **Description** |
|---------------|--------------|
| **ReadWriteOnce (RWO)** | Only **one node** can mount it in read/write mode (EBS, standard PVC). |
| **ReadOnlyMany (ROX)** | Multiple nodes can mount it as **read-only**. |
| **ReadWriteMany (RWX)** | Multiple nodes can mount it in **read/write mode** (EFS, CephFS). |

---

## **📌 Pod with PVC Example**
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx
      volumeMounts:
        - mountPath: "/var/www/html"
          name: storage
  volumes:
    - name: storage
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: dynamic-pvc
```
- The Pod uses the **PVC (`dynamic-pvc`)** for persistent storage.
- It mounts the volume at `/var/www/html`.

---

## **🔥 Key Takeaways**
✔ **Static Provisioning:** Manually create PVs and bind them with PVCs.  
✔ **Dynamic Provisioning:** PVCs request storage dynamically using `StorageClass`.  
✔ **EBS CSI Driver:** Required for AWS EBS-backed persistent storage.  
✔ **Reclaim Policies:** Determines whether storage is retained or deleted.  
✔ **Access Modes:** Defines how volumes can be shared across Pods.
