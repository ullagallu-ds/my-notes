# What is Cloud Computing
Able to access services over the internet like compute, storage, netowrk , databases, load balancers they are providing on demand services rather than maintaining physical hardware or infra locally

Benefits:
- Scalability - when ever require add more servers no need remove
- cost efficiency - pay what you use no upfront payment
- flexibility - access resources anywhere with an internet connection
- reliability - no down time and redundency
- security - invest robust security measures

Public Cloud:
aws,azure,gcp access the services over the internet

Private Cloud:
IBM, internal Data centers only for organization

Hybrid Cloud:
- combination of public and private

Types of Cloud Services
-----------------------
1. Iaas
- servers
- volumes
- network
- Which can be used to build and deploy their own applications and services
- users responsible for managing and maintain the softwares and applications they deploy on infra provided by Iaas
Ex: EC2, S3, VPC, EBS

n/w,storage,servers,virtualization take care by vendor
os,middleware,runtime,data,applications take care by user

2. Pass
without worrying about underlying infra deploy application and test it 
- beanstalk
- lambda
- amazon api gw
- ecs
n/w,storage,servers,virtualizationos,middleware,runtime take care by vendor
data,applications take care by user

3. Saas
- fully managed by vendor
- just use what they are providing for example
- amazon workspaces
- chime
- workdocs

What is Aws
- It is a cloud computing platform provided by aws
- It provides wide range of services compute,networking,storage,iam,databases,ml,analytics..
