You're right! Let's **segregate** the concepts properly.  

### **1. AWS Networking Components**  
These are the core AWS networking services:  
- **VPC** (Virtual Private Cloud)  
- **Subnets** (Public, Private, Isolated)  
- **Route Tables**  
- **Internet Gateway (IGW) & NAT Gateway**  
- **Security Groups & NACLs**  
- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** (ALB, NLB)  
- **Route 53** (DNS, Health Checks, Traffic Routing)  
- **CloudFront** (CDN, Caching)  
- **Direct Connect & VPN** (Hybrid Connectivity)  
- **VPC Peering & Transit Gateway**  

### **2. Core Networking Concepts (Must-Know for AWS Networking)**  
- **IP Addressing & Subnetting (CIDR, Private/Public IPs, IPv4 vs. IPv6)**  
- **DNS (A, CNAME, MX, TXT, NS, PTR, SOA Records)**  
- **DHCP (IP Assignment, Lease Time)**  
- **NAT (SNAT, DNAT, PAT - How AWS NAT Gateway Works)**  
- **Firewalls (Security Groups, NACLs, WAF, Network Firewall)**  
- **ISO/OSI model and TCP/IP models**
- **Load Balancing (Round Robin, Least Connections, AWS ELB types: ALB, NLB)**  
- **Forward Proxy vs. Reverse Proxy (Nginx, Squid Proxy, AWS ALB as Reverse Proxy)**  
- **TLS/SSL (HTTPS, Certificates, ACM in AWS)**  
- **CDN & Caching (CloudFront, Edge Locations)**  

### **3. Advanced Networking Concepts (Beyond AWS Basics)**  
- **BGP & Routing (Used in AWS Direct Connect, Transit Gateway, Hybrid Cloud)**  
- **MTU & Packet Fragmentation (How AWS handles large packets & performance tuning)**  
- **TCP vs. UDP (How AWS NLB supports UDP traffic)**  
- **ICMP, Ping, Traceroute (For AWS network troubleshooting)**  
- **Service Mesh (Istio, App Mesh in AWS, Zero Trust Networking)**  
- **Kubernetes Networking (CNI, Network Policies, Pod-to-Pod Communication)**  

This should help you **categorize everything** based on AWS relevance. Let me know if you need any refinements! ðŸš€
