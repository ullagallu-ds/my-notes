# Security Mastery Guide  

This repository focuses on mastering security in different areas:  
- **Linux Security**  
- **AWS Security**  
- **Container Security**  
- **Kubernetes Security**  

## Security Concepts  

### 1. Hardening  
Hardening refers to strengthening security by reducing vulnerabilities and minimizing attack surfaces.  
- **Linux:** Secure SSH, enable SELinux/AppArmor, limit user privileges  
- **AWS:** Restrict IAM roles, encrypt data, enable MFA  
- **Containers:** Use non-root users, scan images for vulnerabilities  
- **Kubernetes:** Apply RBAC, enforce network policies, restrict pod privileges  

### 2. Compliance  
Compliance ensures systems follow industry security standards and best practices.  
- **Linux:** Follow CIS Benchmarks, enable auditing (`auditd`)  
- **AWS:** Implement AWS Well-Architected Security Framework  
- **Containers:** Apply CIS Docker Benchmark, enforce image security policies  
- **Kubernetes:** Use Admission Controllers (Gatekeeper, Kyverno)  

### 3. Incident Response  
Incident response is the process of detecting, investigating, and mitigating security threats.  
- **Linux:** Log monitoring with `syslog`, detect threats with `tripwire`  
- **AWS:** Investigate security events with GuardDuty & CloudTrail  
- **Containers:** Monitor runtime security with Falco  
- **Kubernetes:** Detect and stop unauthorized pod access  

## Hands-on Learning  
- Simulate attacks and implement security measures  
- Automate security policies and incident response  
- Monitor security logs and alerts  

ðŸš€ **Goal:** Achieve expertise in security best practices across Linux, AWS, Containers, and Kubernetes.
